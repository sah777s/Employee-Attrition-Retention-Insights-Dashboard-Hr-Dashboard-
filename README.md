- This Power BI HR Attrition Dashboard addresses the following key business questions:

- What is the overall attrition rate, and how much does employee turnover cost the organization?

- Which departments and job roles show the highest attrition risk?

- Are top-performing employees (PerformanceRating â‰¥ 4) leaving at an alarming rate?

- Are employees working overtime more likely to leave or experience poor work-life balance?

- What is the relationship between job satisfaction and attrition?

- Which demographic groups (by age, gender, education) are most likely to leave?

- Can a custom attrition risk score help identify at-risk employees proactively?

- What strategic HR actions can improve retention, equity, and engagement?

  ## ðŸ”„ Project Process

1. **ðŸ“¥ Data Collection**  
   - Downloaded HR attrition dataset from **ZoomCharts public dataset repository** (CSV format).

2. **ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning (Excel)**  
   - Checked for duplicates, missing values, and formatting issues.  
   - Standardized column names and cleaned categorical values (e.g., Gender, Department).

3. **ðŸ”Ž Exploratory Data Analysis (Python - Pandas & NumPy)**  
   - Analyzed key trends: Attrition distribution, satisfaction scores, promotion history.  
   - Engineered new fields like `Attrition_Flag` and grouped metrics (e.g., Age Band, Income Band).  
   - Created intermediate summaries and calculated risk metrics.

4. **ðŸ“Š Data Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI)**  
   - Built interactive dashboards with DAX measures for KPIs and attrition insights.  
   - Designed visuals: KPI cards, scatterplots, heatmaps, and demographic filters.  
   - Added dynamic slicers (Department, Gender, Job Role, Age Group) for drill-down analysis.
